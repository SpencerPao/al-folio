I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Arizona with a perfect 4.0 GPA, specializing in software development, probabilistic modeling and machine learning.

As a full-stack developer, I have extensive experience with AWS, Nginx, Docker, React, and Django. During my internship at CoreTechs Consulting Inc., I managed end-to-end website development, created intelligent bots, and deployed applications using advanced cloud services.

My machine learning expertise includes developing GPT-based models at the University of Arizona's Institute for Computation and Data-Enabled Insight. Additionally, I have research projects at the ML4AI LAB and IVI LAB, developing probabilistic graphical models (Dynamic Bayesian Network) to predict human beliefs in search and rescue missions and computationally understand human-beings. Additionally, I contributed to the ToMCAT dataset, exploring team dynamics in urban search and rescue missions using brain scans, physiological signals, and behavioral responses.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
